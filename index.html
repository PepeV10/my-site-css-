        <h3>Playing Video Games</h3>
        <p>My best skill is playing video games, hehe just kidding. Though it is a big passion of mine, I even have a (failing) gaming YouTube Channel. I've been playing video games since I was 4 or 5 years old. Actually, they're what made me love everything related to technology. I hope that with the programming skills that I'll acquire through this and other courses and resources, I'll be able to make my own video games or at least set me in the right path towards that goal. However, if none of that is possible, then I would definitely like to start my own Web Development business and even try to get into Cyber Security field. The truth is that the possibilities are endless once you know how to program/code well, are proficient enough at it and most importantly have a deep passion for it.</p>
